                <h3> Did you know that software developers waste up to 42% of their time on poorly written code? 
                    <br><br>
                    High code quality leads to more maintainable, reliable, and functional code. Without considering code quality you will spend a significantly greater amount of time attempting to fix bugs, improve performance, collaborate effectively, and detect vulnerabilites. 
                    <br><br>
                    Taking code quality into account will also benefit your customer by making your software more consistent and reliable. 
                    <br><br>
                    PyMetrics can provide you and your team with a starting point for improving the quality of your code!</h3>
